## 👩‍💻 About me 
I am a Junior majoring in **Data Science at the University of California, San Diego (UCSD)**. I have participated in several hackathons which have furthered my interest in data analysis and machine learning. In fact, in April 2025, my team and I won first place for our [AI Dance Battle web app](https://devpost.com/software/pose-jam). 

I am involved in Women in Computing (WIC) at UCSD and have served my community through several leadership positions. I currently serve as the Social Chair and strive to create engaging  events to develop an empowering community of technologists. 

## 🔭 My Interests
- problem solving (in my free time, you can find me working on a jigsaw puzzle) 🧩
- sustainability 🌱
- machine learning
- data-driven solutions
  
*Fun Fact: I'm an Eagle Scout ⚜️*
